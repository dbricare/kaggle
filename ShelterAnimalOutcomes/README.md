This [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes) utilizes a dataset 
of intake information from the Austin Animal Center to predict the outcome for each 
animal delivered to the shelter.

Possible outcomes are: Adoption, Died, Euthanasia, Return to owner, Transfer.

The jupyter notebooks in this repository contain exploratory analysis as well as a 
gradient boosting machine to make outcome predictions. 
This model is optimized to reduce the multiclass logarithmic loss.

Since the data size is relatively small, training was done on a late 2013 Macbook Pro.

The dates of this kaggle competition are March 21, 2016 through Jul 31, 2016. 
There are no points or tiers awarded.
